# Slay The Spire: Persistent Upgrades Mod

![](media/screenshot.png)

Slay the Spire too hard? Looking for something to get out of each run? Now you can! With this mod, after every failed run, you get:

- An additional +2 max HP
- Additional +1 strength
- +1 metallicize

These compound over time, so 10 failed runs see you starting with +20 max HP, 10 strength, and 10 metallicize.
